                    <p>Across the United States, many communities face long-term health consequences from industrial activity and environmental neglect. Incidents such as toxic chemical releases, lead contamination, and poor air quality highlight how pollution disproportionately affects low-income areas and people of color.</p>
                    
                    <p>Understanding these disparities is critical for identifying where policy and intervention are most needed. By examining the relationship between pollution exposure, socioeconomic factors, and health outcomes, this project seeks to uncover patterns of environmental injustice and health disparities.</p>
                    
                    <p>Studying these connections not only reveals the human cost of industrial and governmental oversight but also emphasizes the urgent need for equitable public health protections and sustainable environmental practices.</p>

                        <p>While there's significant variation in the relationship between air pollution and COPD rates, counties with higher concentrations of industrial facilities (shown in brighter colors) tend to cluster in areas with elevated air pollution levels, suggesting industrial activity as a key contributor to local air quality issues.</p>
