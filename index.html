                <div class="intro-content">
                    <p>Across the United States, many communities face long-term health consequences from industrial activity and environmental neglect. Incidents such as toxic chemical releases, lead contamination, and poor air quality highlight how pollution disproportionately affects low-income areas and people of color.</p>
                    
                    <p>Understanding these disparities is critical for identifying where policy and intervention are most needed. By examining the relationship between pollution exposure, socioeconomic factors, and health outcomes, this project seeks to uncover patterns of environmental injustice and health disparities.</p>
                    
                    <p>Studying these connections not only reveals the human cost of industrial and governmental oversight but also emphasizes the urgent need for equitable public health protections and sustainable environmental practices.</p>

                    <h3>Air Pollution vs. COPD Prevalence</h3>
                    <div class="viz-description">
                        <p>This scatter plot shows the relationship between air pollution concentration (µg/m³) and COPD prevalence (%) across U.S. counties, with each point colored by the number of industrial facilities in that county. Most counties cluster in a band where air pollution ranges roughly from low to moderate levels, and COPD prevalence spans a wide range within that band. This suggests that pollution is not the only factor affecting COPD risk but it is one of several. Counties with higher facility counts tend to appear in areas with elevated air pollution, highlighting a link between industrial activity and air quality. Overall, the pattern highlights how industry, environment, and health overlap, and it draws attention to a few counties that stand out as potential hotspots for both poor air quality and higher COPD rates.</p>

                        <p>This bar chart shows how many U.S. counties with drinking water violations fall into each majority race or ethnicity category. Most affected counties are majority White (807 counties), with much smaller counts for majority Black, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Asian counties. This pattern likely reflects the fact that most U.S. counties are majority White, but it also highlights that water quality problems occur across communities with different racial and ethnic majorities rather than being concentrated in just one group.</p>

Harris County, TX and Los Angeles County, CA stand out with especially high facility counts, followed by large urban or industrial hubs like Cook County, IL and Jefferson County, TX. The pattern suggests that industrial activity is heavily concentrated in a relatively small set of major metropolitan and refinery/manufacturing regions, which may have important implications for local air and water quality, as well as environmental health risks for residents in these areas.</p>
